    <h2 itemprop="description" class="h2txt">I-V Characteristic Curves</h2>
<p class="lead">The <strong>I-V Characteristic Curves</strong>, which is short for <strong>Current-Voltage Characteristic Curves</strong> or simply <strong>I-V curves</strong>
 of an electrical device or component, are a set of graphical curves 
which are used to define its operation within an electrical circuit. As 
its name suggests, I-V characteristic curves show the relationship 
between the current flowing through an electronic device and the applied
 voltage across its terminals.</p>
<p><em>I-V characteristic curves</em> are generally used as a tool to 
determine and understand the basic parameters of a component or device 
and which can also be used to mathematically model its behaviour within 
an Electronic Circuit.
 But as with most electronic devices, there are an infinite number of 
I-V characteristic curves representing the various inputs or parameters 
and as such we can display a family or group of curves on the same graph
 to represent the various values.</p>
<p>For example, the “current-voltage characteristics” of a bipolar 
transistor can be shown with various amounts of base drive or the I-V 
characteristic curves of a diode operating in both its forward and 
reverse regions.</p>
<p>But the static current–voltage characteristics of a component or 
device need not be a straight line. Take for example the characteristics
 of a fixed value resistor, we would expect them to be reasonably 
straight and constant within certain ranges of current, voltage and 
power as it is a linear or ohmic device.</p>
<p>There are however, other resistive elements such as LDR’s, 
thermistors, varistor’s, and even the light bulb, whose I-V 
characteristic curves are not straight or linear lines but instead are 
curved or shaped and are therefore called non-linear devices because 
their resistances are non-linear resistances.</p>
<p>If the electrical supply voltage, <span class="ntxt">V</span> applied to the terminals of the resistive element <span class="ntxt">R</span> above was varied, and the resulting current, <span class="ntxt">I</span> measured, this current would be characterised as: <span class="ntxt">I = V/R</span>, being one of Ohm’s Law equations.</p>
<p>We know from Ohm’s Law that as the voltage across the resistor 
increases so too does the current flowing through it, it would be 
possible to construct a graph to show the relationship between the 
voltage and current as shown with the graph representing the the 
volt-ampere characteristics (its i-v characteristic curves) of the 
resistive element. Consider the circuit below.</p>
<h3 class="h3txt">I-V Characteristic Curves of an Ideal Resistor</h3>

<div class="bottomspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The above i-v characteristic curves defines the resistive element, in
 the sense that if we apply any voltage value to the resistive element, 
the resulting current is directly obtainable from the I-V 
characteristics. As a result, the power dissipated (or generated) by the
 resistive element can also be determined from the I-V curve.</p>
<p>If the voltage and current are positive in nature, then the I-V characteristic curves will be positive in quadrant <span class="ntxt">Ι</span>, if the voltage and therefore the current are negative in nature then the curve will be displayed in quadrant <span class="ntxt">ΙΙΙ</span> as shown.</p>
<p>In a pure resistance the relationship between voltage and current is 
linear and constant at a constant temperature, such that the current 
(&nbsp;<span class="ntxt">i</span>&nbsp;) is proportional to the potential difference <span class="ntxt">V</span> times the constant of proportionality <span class="ntxt">1/R</span> giving <span class="ntxt">i = (1/R) x V</span>.
 Then the current through the resistor is a function of the applied 
voltage and we can demonstrate this visually using an I-V 
characteristics curve.</p>
<p>In this simple example, the current <span class="ntxt">i</span> against the potential difference <span class="ntxt">V</span>, is a straight line with constant slope <span class="ntxt">1/R</span>
 as the relation is linear and ohmic. However, practical resistors may 
exhibit non-linear behaviour under certain conditions for example, when 
exposed to high temperatures.</p>
<p>There are many electronic components and devices which have non-linear characteristics, that is their <span class="ntxt">V/I</span>
 ratio is not constant. Semiconductor diodes are characterized by 
non-linear current–voltage characteristics as the current flowing 
through a forward-biased common silicon diode is limited by the ohmic 
resistance of the PN-junction.</p>
<h2 class="h2txt">I-V Characteristic Curves of Semiconductors</h2>
<p>Semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors and thyristors are 
all constructed using semiconductor PN junctions connected together and 
as such their I-V characteristics curves will reflect the operation of 
these PN junctions. Then these devices will have non-linear I-V 
characteristics, as opposed to resistors which have a linear 
relationship between the current and voltage.</p>
<p>So for example, the primary function of a semiconductor diode is 
rectification of AC to DC. When a diode is forward biased (the higher 
potential is connected to its Anode), it will pass current. When the 
diode is reverse biased (the higher potential is connected to its 
Cathode), the current is blocked. Then a PN junction needs a bias 
voltage of a certain polarity and amplitude for current to flow. This 
bias voltage also controls the resistance of the junction and therefore 
the flow of current through it. Consider the diode circuit below.</p>
<h3 class="h3txt">I-V Characteristic Curve of a Diode</h3>
<p class="cntr"><img src="images/iv2.gif" alt="diode i-v characteristic curves" title="Diode I-V Characteristic Curves" height="392" width="411"></p>
<div class="bottomspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When the diode is forward biased, anode positive with respect to the 
cathode, a forward or positive current passes through the diode and 
operates in the top right quadrant of its I-V characteristics curves as 
shown. Starting at the zero intersection, the curve increases gradually 
into the forward quadrant but the forward current and voltage are 
extremely small.</p>
<p>When the forward voltage exceeds the diodes P-N junctions internal 
barrier voltage, which for silicon is about 0.7 volts, avalanche occurs 
and the forward current increases rapidly for a very small increase in 
voltage producing a non-linear curve. The “knee” point on the forward 
curve.</p>
<p>Likewise, when the diode is reversed biased, cathode positive with 
respect to the anode, the diode blocks current except for an extremely 
small leakage current, and operates in the lower left quadrant of its 
I-V characteristic curves. The diode continues to block current flow 
through it until the reverse voltage across the diode becomes greater 
than its breakdown voltage point resulting in a sudden increase in 
reverse current producing a fairly straight line downward curve as the 
voltage losses control. This reverse breakdown voltage point is used to 
good effect with zener diodes.</p>
<p>Then we can see that the <strong>I-V Characteristic Curves</strong> 
for a silicon diode are non-linear and very different to that of the 
previous resistors linear I-V curves as their electrical characteristics
 are different. Current-Voltage characteristics curves can be used to 
plot the operation of any electrical or electronic component from 
resistors, to amplifiers, to semiconductors and solar cells.</p>
<p>The current-voltage characteristics of an electronic component tells 
us much about its operation and can be a very useful tool in determining
 the operating characteristics of a particular device or component by 
showing its possible combinations of current and voltage, and as a 
graphical aid can help visually understand better what is happening 
within a circuit.</p>
